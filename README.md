# Unauthorized-Login-Script
Automates log checking to identify attempted unauthorized logins to the server, identifies the most egregious offenders, and adds them to the serverâ€™s firewall.

The script is run using sample_authlog.txt as a parameter, the script then collects the ip's from the auth_log and the user decides what to do with them.

This script was created my senior year for a system administration class.
